## Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jdtoscano94/Instant-AIVT.git
   cd YOUR_REPO_FOLDER
   ```

2. **Download the dataset**:  
   The dataset is available [here](https://datadryad.org/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.jm63xsjnj#readme).

3. **Move the data to the correct directory**:  
   ```sh
   mv path_to_downloaded_data ../Data/Rayleigh-Benard-Convection/
   ```

4. **Run our models using the provided Jupyter notebooks**.  
   The repository includes results for the following models:
   - **cKAN** with **149k parameters**  
   - **MLP** with **151k parameters**  
   - **MLP** with **282k parameters**  

   Each notebook contains all the necessary code to **replicate the results** presented in the paper. The results were generated using **JAX**, ensuring efficient computation with accelerated hardware support.

**Note:** To run these notebooks, you need the source files located in `../Instant_AIVT`. These files should be automatically downloaded when the project is cloned. Ensure that all dependencies are installed before executing the notebooks.
